The relationship between physical matter and the space it uses to orbit within correlates individually to single atoms and whole combinations of atomic-bodies, i.e.humans, trees, plants, animals water and so forth. By understanding the base relationship of an ion, matter can be created or restructured through the electronic "spark"-just like an idea. Either a negative ionic-charge that orbits one way through the already existing atom- or combination of atoms- or elements; OR a positive ionic charge travels in the oppossite way, providing two distinct atomic-orbital mean-frequencies pathways in every atom, in every element and in every living body. The key to being able to create, what most call "dark matter" is not by "voiding" out the negative and positive ionic pathways of an atom or body thereoff by splitting, sdmashing, or collapsing the, we need to remember that as a child grows and expands into adulthood it is due to our ability to create individual matter. Basically, start increasing the orbital velocity and distance of your orbiting protons and neutrons that individually correlate to their atomic center or core-center.
